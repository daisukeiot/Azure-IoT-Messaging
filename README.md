# IoT Data Ingestion with Azure IoT

## Ingest IoT Telemetry with Event Hubs

Experience IoT Telemetry ingestion by :

- Generating telemetry data with producer application
- Consuming telemetry data with a consumer application running in Cloud

[Instruction](EventHubs/README.md)

## Ingest IoT Events with Event Grid

Experience IoT Event ingestion by :

- Generating IoT Events with producer application
- Consuming IoT Events with Event Grid Viewer, Web App

[Instruction](EventGrid/README.md)

## Ingest IoT Telemetry and IoT Events with Azure IoT Hub

Experience IoT Telemetry and Event ingestion by :

- Generating IoT telemetry using Raspberry Pi  
    If you do not have Raspberry Pi, you can use Raspberry Pi Simulator
- Consuming Telemetry with a consumer application  
    The application is the exactly same application used in Event Hub exercise above
